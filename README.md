**Note on permissions**
We value your privacy and security. **Chrome App Launcher** requires additional permissions which the browser will inform about this on installation or first use.**Chrome App Launcher** only uses these permissions for:
- automatically getting the icon for websites you add manually,
- replacing the default app launcher on Google shortcuts with **Chrome App Launcher**,
- making sure the shortcuts launched for Google websites are for the same account that youâ€™re currently signed in on, and
- correctly triggering action shortcuts related to the website youâ€™re on (such as â€˜Gmail send thisâ€™ or â€˜Bookmark thisâ€™).
